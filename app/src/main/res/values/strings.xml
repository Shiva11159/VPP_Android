   If you become a Ventura Partner before 31st March 2019, you will get flat 60% of
the brokerage generated by every new client you introduce, for his / her
first 3 months as a Ventura client
    \n\n
e.g. If your client opens an account in Sept 2018, flat 60% of the brokerage
he or she generates in October, November and December 2018, will be shared
with you, irrespective of the amount of brokerage generated.
</string>
    <string name="terms_conditions">
        The Ventura Partner will introduce his / her contacts only after speaking to them and confirming that they are interested in opening an account with Ventura Securities.
\n\n
        The Ventura Partner will never engage in any unethical or illegal acts in violation of the extant rules and regulations of SEBI and the stock &amp; commodity exchanges.
        \n\n

        In any month, to be eligible to continue referral revenue sharing, you should have
introduced at least 9 New Clients in the immediate preceding 6 months.
If not, the referral revenue sharing dips to 50% of the original slab in the coming
3 months and reduces to 25% of the original slab in the following 3 months.
\n\n
E.g. Considering Sep 2018 as the current month, you should have introduced at least
9 new clients between March and August 2018 (the immediate previous 6 months).
If not, you will receive only 50% of the referral revenue share due you in September,
October and November and only 25% of the referral revenue due to you in December 2018,
January 2019 and February 2019.
\n\n
*If in March 2019, you still do not fulfill the criteria of 9 new clients in the immediate
preceding 6 months then the payout of referral revenue sharing will be stopped.
\n\n
*If in October 2018, you fulfil the criteria of 9 new clients introduced between
April 2018 and September 2018, then 100% of the referral revenue share due to you,
as per the slab, will be given. This means that in any month, if the criterion of
9 new clients to be introduced in the preceding 6 months is fulfilled, the referral revenue
sharing percentage is restored as per the original slab.
  \n\n
    Ventura Securities reserves the right to change the terms and conditions at any point of time in future.
